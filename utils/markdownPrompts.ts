  {
    id: 'blog-post',
    label: 'Blog',
    prompt: `Analyze this content and, if it contains narrative-worthy material, transform it into an engaging article in the style of modern web portals like Pedestrian or Kotaku.
If the content isn't suitable for a blog post (e.g., it's too technical or purely procedural), kindly respond with: "This content might work better with a different format. Consider trying the Summary or Meeting format instead."`
  },
  {
    id: 'meeting-minutes',
    label: 'Meeting',
    prompt: `If this appears to be a discussion or meeting conversation, convert it into formal meeting minutes including:
• Date and participants (if mentioned)
• Key discussion points
• Decisions made
• Action items

If this doesn't appear to be meeting-related content, kindly respond with: "This content doesn't seem to be from a meeting. Perhaps try the Summary or Research format for better results."`
  },
  {
    id: 'technical-spec',
    label: 'Specifications',
    prompt: `If this conversation contains technical discussion or specifications, transform it into a technical specification document with:
• Overview
• Requirements
• Technical Details
• Implementation Notes
• Considerations

If the content lacks technical substance, kindly respond with: "This conversation doesn't contain enough technical details for a specification document. Consider using the Summary or Action Plan format instead."`
  },
  {
    id: 'summary-report',
    label: 'Summary',
    prompt:
      'Create a concise executive summary of this conversation. Focus on key points, decisions, and outcomes. If the content is too brief or lacks substantial points to summarize, kindly note: "This content might be too brief for a meaningful summary. Perhaps try viewing it in its original form."'
  },
  {
    id: 'action-plan',
    label: 'Plan',
    prompt: `Extract and organize any action items or tasks from this conversation into a structured plan. Only include assignees when they are explicitly mentioned in the conversation. Format each item as:
• Task: [description]
• Assignee: [name] (only if explicitly mentioned)
• Suggested timeframe (if mentioned)

If no clear action items are found, respond with: "No specific action items were identified in this conversation. Consider using the Summary format to review the key points instead."`
  },
  {
    id: 'research-notes',
    label: 'Research',
    prompt: `If this conversation contains research-related discussion, format it as research notes with:
• Topics discussed
• Key findings
• Methodologies mentioned
• Areas for further investigation

If the content isn't research-oriented, kindly respond with: "This conversation doesn't appear to contain research-related content. The Summary or Meeting format might be more appropriate."`
  },
  {
    id: 'journal-entry',
    label: 'Journal',
    prompt: `If this conversation contains personal insights, experiences, or reflective content, transform it into a thoughtful journal entry with:
• Key reflections
• Personal/professional impact
• Mindful observations
• A touch of wisdom (quote, tarot insight, or philosophical perspective)

If the content is purely technical or procedural, kindly respond with: "This content might be better suited for a different format, as it doesn't contain personal elements for a journal entry. Consider the Summary or Technical format instead."`
  },
  {
    id: 'case-study',
    label: 'Report',
    prompt: `If this conversation describes a specific situation, problem, or solution implementation, convert it into a case study with:
• Background
• Challenges
• Solutions
• Results
• Lessons Learned

If the content doesn't fit a case study format, kindly respond with: "This conversation doesn't contain enough situation-specific details for a case study. Consider using the Summary or Meeting format instead."`
